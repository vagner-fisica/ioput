that compose the IOput library, is released under

GENERAL USAGE NOTES
----------------------
- This is a free C++ library. So, feel free to add modifications.

- The full original library can be found at 
  https://github.com/vagner-fisica/ioput.git.
 
- Originally, this library is contained into two files:
	ioput.h   -> header: the class declaration.
	ioput.cpp -> source: the class implementation.
  The develper suggestion to use this library in any code is
  to cut all text code from the source and paste it into the end
  of the header file, and remember to EXCLUDE THE LINES WHICH HAS ALL
  EXPLICITY IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR THE CLASS, I.E., THE LAST FOUR LINES
  FROM THE SOURCE FILE. And then put
  	#include "ioput.h"
  at the header of your main .cpp code.
  
- IOput's class constructors:
	
	#1 IOput()
		Default constructor.
	#2 IOput(const char* fname) or IOput(string fname);
		It creates a folder called 'fname' in the working directory.
	
	Every constructor set the default in/out put file extension to
	'.dat', but it can be chenged by calling the method
		change_ext(string new_ext)
	Then, the new extension wil be set to 'new_ext'.

- The main purpose of this library is to handle in a very especific way
  (please check 'documentation.txt') input and output data. Basicaly, the
  present library can be used to save numerical or text data into a file
  with extension '.dat' (default extension) or even load then.
